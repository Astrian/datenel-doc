# Getting Start

Execute the command below to install Datenel in your React project.

```zsh
npm i datenel-react # if you use npm
yarn add datenel-react # if you use yarn
```

Then, you can try Datenel directly in your code like this:

```tsx
import { SingleDatePicker } from "datenel-react"

export default () => {
  return <SingleDatePicker />
}
```

... although it just renders a panel on the page.
