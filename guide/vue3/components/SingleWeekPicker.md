# SingleWeekPicker

## Overview
Datenel also provides a SingleWeekPicker component for selecting a specific week of the year (starts from Monday). Compared to SingleDatePicker, SingleWeekPicker keeps the same layout and includes specific optimization for week selection.

<div style="border: 1px #00000022 solid; overflow: hidden; border-radius: 0.5rem;">
	<iframe src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/datenel-vue3-singleweekpicker?embed=1&file=src%2FApp.vue&hideExplorer=1&hideNavigation=1&view=preview" width="100%" height="500px" style="border: none;" />
</div>

## Preference Props
### `colorScheme`
Customize the color scheme of the component. The object should contain the following properties:

- `mainColor`: The main color of the panel, including the text color and the border color.
- `accentColor`: The accent color of the panel, including the background color of the selected date.
- `borderColor`: The border color of the panel, including the divider color between the header and the body.
- `hoverColor`: The hover color of the panel, including the hover background color of the date.
- `reversedColor`: The reversed color of the panel, including the text color of the selected date.

----

- Type: `{ mainColor: String, accentColor: String, borderColor: String, hoverColor: String, reversedColor: String }`
  - Supports any string value describes color and accepted by CSS.
- Default: `{ mainColor: '#000000', accentColor: '#000000', borderColor: '#e0e0e0', hoverColor: '#00000017', reversedColor: '#ffffff' }`

#### Example

```vue
<SingleWeekPicker 
  :color-scheme={{ 
		mainColor: '#000000', 
		accentColor: '#000000', 
		borderColor: '#e0e0e0', 
		hoverColor: '#00000017', 
		reversedColor: '#ffffff' 
	}} 
/>
```

### `localization`
Datenel will use the language code to localize the panel and accept standard [ISO 639 language codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes), such as `zh-CN`, `en-US`, `ja-JP`, etc. 

::: tip ‚ôøÔ∏è Accessbility reminder
It will not affect the context strings of screen reader aria tags (will be read in English), but the screen reader will still read the date according to this preference.
:::

- Type: `string` (ISO 639 code) 
- Default value: `undefined` (Will follows user browser‚Äôs language) 

#### Example
```vue
<!-- Set the panel‚Äôs localization setting into Simplified Chinese -->
<SingleWeekPicker localization="zh-CN" />
```

### `modelValue` (a.k.a. `v-model`)
Control the selected date programmatically, including situations like providing a default value or controlling the date chosen by the parent component. It also supports the [two-way binding feature](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/v-model.html) of Vue 3, so the model state will be automatically modified when the user selects a date.

- Type: `{weekNum: number, weekYear: number}`
- Default: `undefined`

:::warning üì• What happens when you do not pass the state?
When you do not bind a state property to the `v-model`, the panel becomes read-only. In this situation, the user cannot select a date in the panel, and the select action cannot trigger the panel‚Äôs parent component. This is not a desired behaviour in most cases, so the best practice is to always bind a proper state property to it.
:::

#### Example
```vue
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'
import { SingleWeekPicker } from 'datenel-vue3'
const week = ref({ weekYear: 2025, weekNum: 1 })
</script>

<template>
<SingleDatePicker v-model="week" />
</template>
```

## Trigger Props
### `@close() => void`
A screen-reader-exclusive property. The user is required to close the panel without selecting a specific date. 

The close button is not visible, but screen readers can read this button. The screen reader‚Äôs close button is only available when this prop is not `undefined`.

#### Function parameters

No parameters.

#### Return value
This callback function does not require any return value.

#### Example
```vue
<SingleWeekPicker @close="presentPanel(false)" />
```
