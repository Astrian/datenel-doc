# Getting Start

Execute the command below to install Datenel in your Vue 3 project.

```zsh
npm i datenel-vue3 # if you use npm
yarn add datenel-vue3 # if you use yarn
```

Then, you can try Datenel directly in your code like this:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import {SingleDatePicker} from 'datenel-vue3'
</script>

<template>
  <SingleDatePicker />
</template>
```

... although it just renders a panel on the page.
